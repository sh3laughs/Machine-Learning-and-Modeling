# Setup ----
# A retailer wants to create a simulation to predict the profit on the sales of 
  # a certain tool she carries. She knows the profit is a function of several 
  # factors, for which she has historical data:
    # Units Sold: Normal distribution, with a mean of 26 units and a standard 
      # deviation of 5.7 units.
    # Price: Discrete distribution. 55% of the time the price is 38 dollars, 
      # 30% of the time the price is 41.50 dollars, and 15% of the time is 
      # 36.25 dollars.
    # Cost: Uniform distribution, with a max of 33.72 dollars and a min of 
      # 26.88 dollars.
    # Resource Factor: Normal distribution, with a mean of 3 and a standard 
      # deviation of 1.2.
  # The function for profit is as follows:
    # Profit = (RF * (Units sold) * (Price)) - ((0.2) * (RF) * (Units sold) * 
      # (Cost)) + $320
# Create a simulation that has 100 rows of monthly profits. Once you have 
# completed this simulation exercise, prepare a report stating what you did, 
# what you learned, and your results. You have the option to complete your 
# simulation in either R, Python or Excel. Then submit it for grading.

# Units Sold ----
  # Normal distribution, with a mean of 26 units and a standard deviation of 
  # 5.7 units.
unitsSold = rnorm(100, 26, 5.7)
# Note: New variable in environment with 100 values


# Price ----
  # Discrete distribution. 55% of the time the price is 38 dollars, 30% of the 
  # time the price is 41.50 dollars, and 15% of the time is 36.25 dollars.

# Cost ----
  # Uniform distribution, with a max of 33.72 dollars and a min of 26.88 
  # dollars.

# The function for profit ---
  # Profit = (RF * (Units sold) * (Price)) - ((0.2) * (RF) * (Units sold) * 
  # (Cost)) + $320
